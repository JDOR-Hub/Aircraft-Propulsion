# Preliminary Design of Axial-Flow Compressor 

## Description
The projects blends theoretical analysis with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The methodology begins with a thorough examination
of fundamental concepts and theories related to axial flow compressors, followed by the identification of key parameters for defining compressor geometry. After establishing mathematical solutions, a 3D model is created. Using this information, a mesh is implemented to enable effective simulation of the compressorâ€™s behavior in Ansys CFX, facilitating the analysis of results.

## Future Work
- [ ] Improve 3D model for Rotator and Stator.
- [ ] Blades airfoil design must be integrated in the proect methodology.
- [ ] Update Ansys simulation with a more accurated initial conditions.
