# Machine Learning Implementation for Predicting Turbofan Gas Emissions

## Description
This folder contains an impletation of machine learning for predicting turbofan gas emissions according with ICAO engine emission certification. This, by analysing the take-off condition using three engine parameters: bypass ratio, pressure ratio and rated thrust. The database is sourced from ICAO databank. The project implements a general workflow when working with machine learning and finally three models are compared: 

1. Random Forest with Grid Search Hyperparameters (RF-GS).
2. Random Forest with Polynomial Features (RF-PF).
3. Convolutional Neural Networks with Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM).

## Future Work
- Correction on the metrics indexes.

## Notes
- This is a basic study on the effects of machine learning in turbofan engines.
- Look into alternative database solutions.
- Code refactoring for better maintainability.

## Info
- Project is not currently being developed.
