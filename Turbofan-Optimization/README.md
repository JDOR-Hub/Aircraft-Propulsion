# Thermodynamic Cycle Optimization of a Turbofan Engine

## Description
This study employs numeric simulations to optimize the thermodynamic cycle of a
turbofan engine by varying compressor pressure ratios (CPR), bypass ratios (BPR), turbine inlet temperatures (TiT), and fan pressure ratios (FPR) for two case studies: Take-off and Cruise at 10 km altitude. Parameters are explored within specified ranges. Through iterative optimization, the research identifies optimal parameter combinations to enhance engine performance by analyzing specific thrust output and specific fuel consumption. Additionally, a comparison of results is carried out with data from the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM. By selecting key design factors, the net thrust and CO2 footprint are determined.
